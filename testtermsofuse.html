      <div class="content">
      <br><br>
      <span>This Section applies to Game Den Services for play on a Personal Computer ("Game Den PC Products"). To access and use Game Den Services associated with an Game Den PC Product, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with the Game Den PC Product.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="color: #003366;">A. Technical and Content Protection Measures</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>Game Den utilizes certain technical or content protection measures to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of an Game Den PC Product. Game Den PC Products use Origin Online Activation and also may use Sony DADC Austria AG's Denuvo content protection technology. To see which games use Denuvo, visit <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal">https://www.ea.com/legal</a>. An Game Den Account, including the acceptance of this Agreement and Game Den's Privacy and Cookie Policy at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACY/US/en/PC/">privacy.ea.com</a>, installation of the Origin client application (<a href="https://www.origin.com/en-us/about">https://www.origin.com/en-us/about</a>), acceptance of the Origin EULA, and an Internet connection are required to authenticate the Game Den PC Product and verify your license upon the initial launch of the Game Den PC Products on any unique machine ("Authenticate" or "Authentication"). The serial code provided with this Game Den PC Products will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one Game Den Account per serial code, which means the Game Den PC Product is not transferable. Game Den may validate your license by subsequent online Authentication. There is no limit to the total number of machines on which the Game Den PC Products can be Authenticated, but you may launch and access the Game Den PC Product on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period. If you attempt to circumvent, disable or tamper with these technical protection measures, the Game Den PC Product may not function properly and this License shall terminate for your material breach. Keep your serial code because you may need it to install the Game Den PC Service on other machines. This technology may interfere with certain applications, such as debuggers, that can be used to circumvent access-control technology.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="color: #003366;">B. Monitoring</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>Game Den utilizes certain technologies to detect and prevent cheating in connection with the use of Game Den PC Products. These are described below. You can visit <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal">https://www.ea.com/legal</a> to know which technology is used with each Game Den PC Product.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>
        <span style="color: #003366;">Punkbuster.</span> Game Den may use Punkbuster Anti-Cheat technology from Even Balance, Inc. You may opt to install Punkbuster during the installation of an Game Den PC Product. If it is installed, when you connect online to a game server using Punkbuster, Punkbuster will monitor your computer's random access memory (RAM) for Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the Game Den PC Product and any modifications to the Game Den PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating. An Unauthorized Third Party Program is a third party program or file (such as a "addon", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that Game Den believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type: (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by Game Den: or (iii) intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game. If you uninstall the Game Den PC Product, Punkbuster will remain dormant on your computer. To uninstall Punkbuster, run the executable at <a href="https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe">https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe</a>.
      Game Den may use its own or Third Party anti-cheat technologies.
    </span>
      <br><br>
      <span>
        <span style="color: #003366;">Game Den Anti-Cheat Technologies.</span> Game Den may use its own anti-cheat technologies. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies will activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the Game Den PC Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detects cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your account name, details about an Unauthorized Third Party Program and the Game Den PC Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. We also may terminate your License and your Game Den Account if we determine you have been cheating.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>When you disconnect from the game server, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span style="color: #003366;">C. Uninstalling</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>You may uninstall Game Den PC Products at any time within your game settings in the Origin client. Certain locally saved files may remain on your computer after uninstallation. You may manually delete these files by searching for the game title in your My Documents folder on PC or via the file finder on a Mac.</span>

                <div class="content">
                <br><br>
                <span><b>THIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL CONSUMERS AND PEOPLE WHO ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IT EXCLUDES RESIDENTS OF QUEBEC, RUSSIA, SWITZERLAND, BRAZIL, MEXICO, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EEA, UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Game Den EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</b></span>
                <br><br>
                <span>This Section offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between us if they arise. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by logging into the Game Den customer support interface with your Account at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/">help.ea.com</a>. If Game Den cannot resolve your concern, you and Game Den agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this Section to resolve any and all disputes between us.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>This Section is an agreement between you and Game Den, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. This Section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">A. Claims Covered by Arbitration</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Game Den Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and Game Den ("Disputes") shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, Game Den's or Game Den's licensors' trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australia consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">B. Informal Negotiations</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>You and Game Den shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Game Den will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">C. Binding Arbitration</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>If you and Game Den cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or Game Den may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send Game Den a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, Game Den will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and Game Den may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">D. Limitations</span>
                <br><br>
                <span><b>YOU AND Game Den AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">E. Location</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>If you live in the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and Game Den agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: #003366;">F. Recovery</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against Game Den and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than Game Den's last written settlement offer made before Game Den makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then Game Den will:</span>
                <br><br>
      <ol style="font-family: calibri;">
        <li>Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and</li>
        <li>Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.</li>
      </ol>
      <span style="color: #003366;">G. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>Game Den will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.</span>
