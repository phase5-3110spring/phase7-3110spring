                    <p>To find your video game, please search by the title or UPC located on the back of the case. Many titles have multiple versions available. Make sure to select the correct version of your game to receive the correct quote.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We buy video games in new and used condition.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">Brand new</span> video games have not been played and are still in plastic wrap.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">Used</span> video games may have been played once, twice, or several times. Used video games must be sent with the original case and game instructions in order for the price quote to valid. The product may have minor scratches but plays perfectly. We do not buy heavily scratched / damaged games or games that do not work. These items will be discarded and not returned to you.</li>

                <h2 class="daredevil" id="PaymentLessQuote">Why was my payment less than quoted?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Prices are based on the condition and UPC of the product received in our warehouse. If the condition or UPC does not match the product as you entered it, your quote will be adjusted to the proper payment for the item received. Please give accurate information about your video game and pack your shipment well. Please review our packaging guidelines to ensure the safe arrival of your video game(s).</p>

                <h2 class="daredevil" id="HowDoesShipWork">How does shipping work?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>TextbookRush will provide you with a prepaid shipping label that you can print out from your computer. Delivery Confirmation is included with the label, so you can verify that the item successfully arrived at our location. The cost of this label is billed to us, so you never have to worry about it. Need more labels? No problem, just visit your account and click on the buyback in question. Then click “Add a shipping label”. You can request as many free labels as you need.</p>
                    <p>Shipping methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>FedEx (Pre-paid label) is the carrier for buyback shipments. FedEx
                            guarantees delivery in 1-5 business days. Drop off packages with FedEx labels at
                            the nearest FedEx drop off location or arrange for a free pickup from a business
                            by calling 1-800-GO-FEDEX. When dropping off your package, please select a FedEx
                            Staffed, FedEx Kinkos, or FedEx Authorized ShipCenter. Uncheck the box next to FedEx
                            Self-Service locations since they are unable to accept your package. Pickups must
                            be scheduled from a business, not a residence. If you call to schedule a pickup,
                            make sure to mention you have a “return label.”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">Please note that these times are estimates and we are not liable for delays that are out of our control.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Please be sure you have the latest version of Adobe Reader installed on your computer.

                <h2 class="daredevil" id="AdvantageFedexOverUSPS">What is the advantage of using FedEx over USPS Ground?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>FedEx guarantees delivery in 1-5 business days. Each order shipped via FedEx is
                        automatically insured. USPS Ground usually takes 4-14 business days to arrive.
                        We strongly suggest you purchase insurance when shipping your buyback to us via
                        USPS Ground, however optional insurance for USPS Ground packages is not an expense
                        TextbookRush covers. If you ship your buyback order to us using USPS Ground,
                        TextbookRush is not responsible for packages lost in transit, however, buybacks
                        shipped through FedEx are insured for $100 per label.</p>
